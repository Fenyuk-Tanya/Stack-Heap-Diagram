Stack:
1.The main method:
       name → reference to string "Kevin".
       list → a reference to an ArrayList object
       times → the value is 10.
2.The fill method:
       collection → link to list.
       str → reference to string "KevinKevin".
       times → the value is 10.
       shrunk → reference to the line "Kevin".
3.The shrink method (temporarily during the call):
       str → link to "KevinKevin".
       chars → character array ['K', 'e','v', 'i', 'n'].

Heap:
1.String objects:
       "Kevin" (from name).
       "KevinKevin" (from name + name).
       "Kevin" (from shrink).
2.Object ArrayList (list):
       Contains a reference to the line "Kevin" three times (through a loop in fill).
